## Status
Project is complete and an [interactive demo is available here](https://ravenblack24.github.io/markdown-previewer/).

## General info
This app was built to satisfy and subsequently validated against the following User Stories:

- **User Story #1**: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

- **User Story #2**: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

- **User Story #3**: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

- **User Story #4**: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

- **User Story #5**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

- **User Story #6**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

- **Optional Bonus**: My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Technologies
* React.js, vanilla Javascript and react-helmet

## Setup
In the project directory you should run:

`npm install`

Installs the required libraries.

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!
